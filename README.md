Stardom's Colors is a mod that allows the player to dye various blocks by right clicking them with a dye. These blocks offer more customization than the regular vanilla counterparts as it allows you to mix various dye colors to get the specific block color you're looking for.

The current list of dyeable blocks are the following:
- Wool
- Beds
- Terracotta
- Concrete Powder (Converts into the corresponding color of concrete when hardened)
- Bricks
- Stained Glass
- Stained Glass Panes
- Candles
- Bundles (combine bundle with a dye in a crafting table)

This mod also adds the following blocks which can be created by taking their corresponding base block and putting it in a Stonecutter:
- Terracotta Slabs
- Concrete Slabs
- (Stairs, walls, etc. planed for future updates)
